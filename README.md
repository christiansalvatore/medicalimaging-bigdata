## Syllabus
* Statistical Parametric Mapping  
* Texture Analysis
* Segmentation of Medical Images
* Feature Reduction and Selection Techniques
* Radiomics / Radiogenomics
* From Medical Images to Disease Biomarkers
* Predictive Models

## Exam modality
The exam is composed of a practical session and a theoretical session.

The practical session consists in completing and presenting a project. For this task, students will be divided into groups, which will be evaluated based on the project development and implementation and on the final presentation. A qualitative score will be assigned to each group (not to each student individually).

The theoretical session consists in an oral examination with questions regarding the theoretical lessons of the course and a follow-up about a scientific paper. The evaluation of this session will be individual.

A final score will be assigned to each student individually, considering both the evaluation of the practical session and the oral examination.

## Requirements
During the course (practical sessions) and the implementation of the final projects, we will make use of [Matlab](https://it.mathworks.com/) (The MathWorks). Because of this, students are required to download and install Matlab on their laptops.

Another required software package is Statistical Parametric Mapping, which is freely available for download on the [dedicated webpage](https://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) of the Wellcome Centre for Human Neuroimaging.
