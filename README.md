## Exam modality
The exam is composed of a practical session and a theoretical session.
The practical session consists in completing and presenting a project. For this task, students will be divided into groups, which will be evaluated based on the project development and implementation and on the final presentation. A qualitative score will be assigned to each group (not to each student individually).

The theoretical session consists in an oral examination with questions regarding the theoretical lessons of the course and a follow-up about a scientific paper. The evaluation of this session will be individual.

A final score will be assigned to each student individually, considering both the evaluation of the practical session and the oral examination.
